Feature: Create Meetup
    In order to create a meetup
    As a anonymous user
    I want to be able to create a meetup on the application

Rules:
- title must be between 4 and 50 characters long
- description must be between 10 and 2000 characters long
- meetup's begin must be before meetup's end

Scenario: I create a meetup when I fill title, description, meetup's begin, meetup's end
    Given I am on the meetup's create page
        And I fill the form with title "meetup1", description "short description", begin "01/01/2018" and end "02/01/2018"
    When I submit the form
    Then I should be redirect to the list of meetups with my new meetup placed after other meetup present

Scenario: I create a meetup when I fill title, description, meetup's begin, meetup's end
    Given I am on the meetup's create page
        And I fill the form with title "mee", description "short description", begin "01/01/2018" and end "02/01/2018"
    When I submit the form
    Then I should see an error on the title saying "the input is less than 4 characters long"

Scenario: I create a meetup when I fill title, description, meetup's begin, meetup's end
    Given I am on the meetup's create page
        And I fill the form with title "meetup1", description "short", begin "01/01/2018" and end "02/01/2018"
    When I submit the form
    Then I should see an error on the description saying "the input is less than 10 characters long"

Scenario: I create a meetup when I fill title, description, meetup's begin, meetup's end

    Then I should see an error on the description saying "Start time must be before end time"
