Feature: Edit Meetup
    In order to edit a meetup
    As a anonymous user
    I want to be able to change information about a meetup on the application

Rules:
- title must be between 4 and 50 characters long
- description must be between 10 and 2000 characters long
- meetup's begin must be before meetup's end

Scenario: I edit a meetup by changing any of these informations: title, description, meetup's begin, meetup's end
    Given I am on the meetup's edit page
        And I change the form with title "meetup2", description "long description", begin "01/01/2019" and end "02/01/2019"
    When I submit the form
    Then I should be redirect to the list of meetups with my updated meetup placed at the same place he was before

Scenario: I edit a meetup by changing any of these informations: title, description, meetup's begin, meetup's end
    Given I am on the meetup's edit page
        And I don't change any informations
    When I submit the form
    Then I should be redirect to the list of meetups with my updated meetup placed at the same place he was before
